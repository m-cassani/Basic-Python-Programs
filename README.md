# Basic-Python-Programs
List of programs:

1) Sum of digits:
    This program receives an integer number as input and returns the sum of all digits of it.
    Examples: 135 -> 1 + 3 + 5 = 9  or 123456789 -> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45
  
2) Prime number or not:
    This program receives a positive integer number as input and returns if it is a prime number or not.
    Examples: 151 -> It is a prime number! or 6513332 -> Not a prime number.
    
3) Equal adjacent digits:
    This program receives a positive integer number as input and returns if it has equal adjacent digits in it.
    Examples: 123456789 -> It doesnt have equal adjacent digits. or 1324556931 -> It has equal adjacent digits!
    
4) Highest prime number:
    This program receives an integer number higher than 1 as input and returns the highest prime number below or equal to it.
    Examples: 100 -> 97  or 5000 -> 4999 or 6235 -> 6229. Obs: It may run slow for numbers higher than 100k.
